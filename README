Brainfuck interpreter.

Reading (,) and writing (.) over serial port.

Most of the trickiness is dealing with looping: "[" and "]".

Execution starts when <return> is pressed.
And finishes if we run off the end of the program, or we error.
Errors are: memory-pointer under/over flow, nesting count overflow

leds display: running, waiting-for-rx, -,-,-, 3x error conditions

Program is hardcoded - currently "fibs"
Currently FPGA regs are used for memory, so very limited. Plan to use SDRAM.
